Option: Command Shell

Test Step 1:
(1) Run ./myprogram < ./testhw
    You will see that it prints
    Hello World!
    Program was successful
    which is correct because testhw prints the first line of text and then it exits with 0.

(2) Run ./myprogram < ./testfailhw
    You will see that it prints
    Hello World! (but somehow failed)
    Program failed with code 1
    which is correct because testfailhw prints the first line of text and then it exit with EXIT_FAILURE which is code 1.
